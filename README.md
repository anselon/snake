Snake Revamped

To run the game download Panda3d's runtime AND SDK at http://www.panda3d.org/

In the command prompt locate the snake directory and type:

ppython main.py 

to run the game.

(ppython stands for panda python)

We ran into some compatibility issues with Mac OSX, so it would be best to run on windows if possible.
